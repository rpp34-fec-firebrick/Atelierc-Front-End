# FEC

Hello! Welcome to our team's Front End Capstone or FEC for short.

We had the oppurtunity to use some pretty darn cool technologies including React, Jest, HTML, CSS, Axios, Express and hopefully to no suprise Javascript!

Keegan Wolf responsible for the Question & Answers Section
King-Man Chow responsible for the
Alex B responsible for the

We're all excited for you to take a look at our project and can't wait to tell you more about it!
